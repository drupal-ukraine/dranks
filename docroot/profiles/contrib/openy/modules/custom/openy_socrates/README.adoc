Welcome to Socrates
=====

Socrates is a OOP representation of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern for OpenY to cover needs of
pluggable distributed Data Wrapper services by priority.

Basically, if you have a membership calculator which should be used for display same thing but for different Data
Services, Socrates give you a convenient opportunity to define which service should be used for obtaning data
on specific project. The highest in priority service will be chosen for retreiving data.

For connecting your service to Socrates you need to

- implement OpenyDataServiceInterface for the service's class
- extend your_module.services.yml with a tags

```
  example_socrates_data_service:
    class: Drupal\openy_socrates\ExampleSocratesDataService
    tags:
      - { name: openy_data_service, priority: 1000 }
```

- replace the Data service with Socrates everywhere you need to have an ability to prioritize Data retrieving.
